<p>
    You are given an array with positive numbers and a number <strong>N</strong>.
    You should find find N-th power of N-the element of the array.
    If N is outside on the array, then return -1.
    Don't forget that the first element has 0 index.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at examples:<br>
    - array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3<sup>2</sup> == 9;<br>
    - array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is greater than the length of the array, so the result is -1.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. An array as a tuple of integers and a number as a integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The result as an integer.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
index_power([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) == 9
index_power([1, 3, 10, 100], 3) == 1000000
index_power([0, 1], 0) == 1
index_power([1, 2], 3) == -1

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Here you will look at array indexes and simple math operation - power.

    0 &lt; len(array) &le; 10<br>
    0 &le; N<br>
